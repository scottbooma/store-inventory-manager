# Store Inventory Manager

Welcome to Rose Apothecary! To use our inventory manager please click [here](https://scottbooma.github.io/store-inventory-manager/). It doesn't actually work at that link because it can't access `date-fns` but if you clone the repo, run `npm install`, and serve it up with Parcel then it will work seamlessly!
